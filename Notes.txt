Today - 9/4/25
I learnt something new. the use of the code below:
#       if __name__ == "__main__":   
            number_guessing_game()       #

""" If you're importing this file into another file (like import guessing_game), it will not run the game automatically — it just loads the functions for you to use.
The code prevents the game from starting if you’re using the file elsewhere, like for testing, combining with another project, or importing functions.
Try removing that block and placing just number_guessing_game() at the bottom. The game still works when run directly, but now it’ll also run anytime it’s imported into another script — which is not always ideal. """
